    <h2 class="special_title">Spanish Songs</h2>
    <p class="static_p">Growing up as a hispanic child, I was forced to listen to Mexican songs when we were in the car.
        At first I did not like listening to these songs, but you never really appreciate things until you are older.
        The issue was that I did not understand the songs as I do now. These songs are so fucking fire.
        Nothing but straight bangers, and alot of this has to do with Spanish being such a good language.
        It feels like emotions are conveyed better and with much deeper feelings. Like I will hear a heartbreak or sad song 
        and just feel it much more than I would if the song was in English. Anyway here is a list of Spanish songs that I love
        listening to at the moment in no particular order.
